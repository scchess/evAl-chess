Garry Kasparov held his own against Deep Blue in '96. But while Kasparov looked at on the order of 3 positions per second, his computer opponent looked at millions; engines make up for a low-level evaluation function by simply looking at more positions.

The idea of creating a slower but higher-level evaluation function isn't new: NeuroChess and Giraffe are two examples of engines that search few nodes but that also play well. I'm working on evAl-chess with this idea in mind. A human-strength engine that searches a similar number of positions per second would be a challenge to create (toungue very much in cheek) so perhaps 10,000 positions per second (position Hz) is a good goal -- that is, while playing at, say, a 2200 FIDE level.
